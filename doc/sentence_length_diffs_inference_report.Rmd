# Summary

For this project we have carried out a hypothesis test to determine if there was a significant difference in the median sentence lengths between the indigenous and non-indigenous offenders under the Correction Services Canada.

The median was selected as the measure of central tendency as the distributions of sentence length for both groups were right-skewed. Subsequently, a permutation test under the null model was carried out computationally with a significance level of **0.05**. The null hypothesis stated that there was no difference in the population medians in sentence lengths between indigenous and non-indigenous inmates. The alternative hypothesis stated that there was a difference in the population medians in sentence length between indigenous and non-indigenous offenders. The resulting sample difference in the two medians was `r diff_medians`, with a corresponding p-value of `r p_value`. The indigenous group was found to have shorter sentence lengths than the non-indigenous group. As this $p$-vaule was smaller than the significance level, there was statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis that stated that there was no difference in the median sentence lengths between the two groups.

We had a large sample size for both groups, so the model was very sensitive to small differences in the median variation. Although this may raise some concern regarding the practical implications of the study, we believed it was important not to miss any existing effect. We concluded that minimizing Type II error was more important than a Type I error.

# Introduction

The number of indigenous incarcerations in Canada has increased by 40% in the prison system over the last decade, a faster rate than any other group [@owusu2014years]. Issues such as increased domestic violence, disruptions in societal structure, and health issues are known to be aggravated in highly incarcerated groups [@freudenberg2001jails]. Hence, these rates are likely to worsen.

As this population is so vulnerable, the other key factor that should be investigated is if there is a difference in the length of the sentence between the indigenous and non-indigenous groups. This is an important question to infer because if a significant difference is discovered, it can lead to further studies on the type of charges either group is subject to, or whether any particular laws disadvantage the indigenous group. Additionally, the study could also lead to an exploration of biases present in the current legal system during sentencing.

# Methods

Methodology for this study follows the basic principles of hypothesis testing. Data processing and specifics of the analysis discussed below.

## Data

The data set used for this study is the Offender Profile from 2017-2018 released by the Correctional Service of Canada. The link to this site can be found [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/844ff1e3-e137-41be-9ebe-6bd9843c1a53). Each entry in the data set corresponds to a single offender serving a two or more year-long sentence. The demographic details such as age, gender, and marital status at year-end are provided for each entry. This was retrieved from the Offender Management System (OMS). For the purposes of our inquiry, we dropped all columns except the racial grouping and the aggregated sentence length.

```{r counts, inlude=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
counts <- read_csv('../results/group_counts.csv')
count_non_ind <- counts[1,2]|>pull()
count_ind <- counts[2,2]|>pull()
```

After cleaning up and removing the rows with undetermined lengths of sentence, the data set contained the total of `r format(count_ind)` records with race_grouping = "Indigenous" and `r format(count_non_ind)` records with race_grouping = "None Indigenous".

## Analysis

A hypothesis test with a significance level of **0.05** was carried out to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the medians of the sentence length between the indigenous and non-indigenous groups. The features used from the data set to complete this analysis were the racial grouping, which was already separated into indigenous and non-indigenous, and aggregate sentence length. The median was selected as the measure of central tendency and the permutation test under the null hypothesis. During data processing, we removed all columns except racial grouping and the aggregated sentence length. Hence the hypothesis test was defined as the following:

$H_0$: The median length of sentences of indigenous group, $M_1$, is equal to the median length of sentences of non-indigenous group, $M_2$.

$H_A$: The median length of sentences of indigenous group, $M_1$, is not equal to the median length of sentences of non-indigenous group, $M_2$.

Test statistic: $\hat{M}_1-\hat{M}_2$.

The R [@R] and Python programming languages [@Python] and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: docopt [@docopt], knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], infer [@infer], docopt [@docoptpython] and altair [@altair]. The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_inference_on_indigenous_vs_non_indigenous_sentence_length_differences).

# Results and discussion

The only relevant columns for our hypothesis test were the 'aggregate sentence length' and the 'racial grouping'. 'Racial grouping' column was included in the report and summarized data from the 'race' columns into two categories. "Aboriginal" corresponded to the offenders with a race of "First Nations", "MÃ©tis", or "Inuit". "Non Aboriginal" corresponded to all others. Note that this information was self-reported.

All other columns were dropped. While there were mo missing values, some sentences are of indeterminate length, and could not be used in the analysis. We also dropped all the rows with indeterminate sentences. At the end of data processing, the count of observations in either group was `r format(count_ind)` and `r format(count_non_ind)`. This provided a large enough sample size.

```{r observations_group}
knitr::kable(counts, caption = "Table 1. Number of observations in each group.", col.names = c("Group",
                           "Count of Offenders"))
```

<br /> To decide what kind of measure of central tendency to apply in our hypothesis test, we looked at the distribution of the sentence lengths of either group (orange - non-indigenous, blue - indigenous) using a density plot (Figure 1.) The distributions for both groups were right-skewed, so we decided to use the median as our parameter because it is less affected by the outliers in the data.

```{r desnity, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Figure 1. The distribution of the aggregate sentence length of offenders by racial group. Both distributions are right-skewed.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../results/eda-densities.png')
```

We then graphed our sample using box-plots to get a visual understanding of the sentence length distribution in percentiles (Figure2.)

Looking at these box plots, we noted the large overlap in the quantiles between the two groups, which at a glance indicated that a statistically significant difference was unlikely. Nonetheless, we decided to carry on with the hypothesis test, because intuition can be misleading.

```{r boxplots, fig.width=10, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Figure 2. The boxplot of the sentence length of offenders by racial group. The whiskers of the box plot represent the range 1.5*IQR above the upper-quartile and below the lower-quartile. The marker at the center of the box corresponds to the median. Note the logarithmic scale.", out.width='100%'}

knitr::include_graphics('../results/eda-box_plots.png')
```

We had a large enough sample size to apply a permutation test as the total sample size was `r format(count_ind + count_non_ind)`. We carried out the permutation test with 5,000 under the null hypothesis, computing and comparing the median for each of the two groups.

The null hypothesis stated that there is no difference in the median sentence lengths between the indigenous and non-indigenous offenders. The alternate hypothesis stated that there is a difference in the median sentence lengths between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. The test statistic was the difference in the sample medians of the two groups. The significance level was set to **0.05**.

The distribution under the null hypothesis had the anticipated normal shape due to the provided large sample size and number of repetitions. It appeared slightly left-skewed.

```{r Null Distribution 3, fig.width=10, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Figure 3. The distribution of the medians generated using a permutation test under the null distribution. The observed difference in means (-56 days) falls outside of the 95% CI which means we can reject the H0 at the significance level of 0.05.", out.width='100%'}

```

The difference in the sample test medians was `r diff_medians`, which corresponded to a p-value of `r p_value` from the two-tailed test. The test statistic falls beyond the left tail in the distribution. As the $p$-value is smaller than the significance level of **0.05**, we can state that there is statistically significant evidence to reject $H_0$. Hence there is a significant difference in the sentence length of sentences between indigenous and non-indigenous offenders in the Correctional Services of Canada.

Though our study discovered a statistical significance in the difference in the estimates, the practical takeaway must take into consideration the effect size, the sample size, and possible sources of error. The sample size of both groups in the study was very large, and therefore our model was very sensitive to small effects. This allowed us to lower the risk of committing Type II error, in which we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. Missing out on a difference in sentence lengths between the two groups is costly as it will curb efforts to conduct further studies on the issue. This will be detrimental to the already vulnerable indigenous population.

A follow-up study to this could combine the offenders' data from multiple years to increase the sample size, and potentially conduct the hypothesis test with a larger alpha value. Additionally, a study that controls for other variables, most notably the nature of the offence, could give us a better and more nuanced understanding of the possible correlations and dynamics.
